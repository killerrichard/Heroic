  "Changing the retro scene, one line at a time"
 </p>
 
 <br><br>
 
 
 <h2>Introduction</h3>
 <p>Heroic was introduced to the scene as a standard alternative to the base websites available for running your service.  Over time
 our product has grown into an advanced system capable of not only creating the entire retro, but maintaining it (efficiently) and 
 providing a quality code-base for other developers to maintain if they wished.</p>
 
 <br><br>
 
 <h2>Heroic Two</h2>
 <p>The second version of Heroic came quickly following the initial release.  Many issues with both code readability, scaling and
 just unforseen bugs were found in the first 1.x builds leading to a complete rewrite on both the front and back-end.  The second version
 is built around maintainability for future updates and providing a bulk of features.</p>
